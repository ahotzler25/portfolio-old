                        <p><em>Description:</em></p>
                        <p> A dummy website to mimic a library's administrative database. 
                            The HTML and CSS were provided by the course, requiring only 
                            the JavaScript be submitted. The completed project provided a 
                            home page for general statistics regarding rented books and 
                            popular categories. The "Stats by Book" page provided a list 
                            of every book housed by the library, with a history of recent 
                            borrowers, the author, genre, and if is is currently returned 
                            or rented out. Finally, the "Stats by Account" page listed every 
                            library member alphabetically by last name, with a profile picture, 
                            general information about the member, as well as how many total 
                            books have been borrowed by the member.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p><em>Purpose:</em></p>
                        <p>This project was designed to test my ability to 
                            create functions, higher order functions, various methods 
                            (such as find, filter, and map), and utilize string literals, 
                            among other learning objectives. I was to link the three 
                            databases (each styled as an object within a .js file) and 
                            output the results onto the web app. A total of 14 functions 
                            across 3 files were necessary to complete, with an additional 
                            helper function required to assist in at least one of the other 
                            functions.</p>
