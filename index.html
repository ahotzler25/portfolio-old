                            The HTML and CSS were provided by the course, requiring only 
                            the JavaScript be submitted. The completed project provided a 
                            home page for general statistics regarding rented books and 
                            popular categories. The "Stats by Book" page provided a list 
                            of every book housed by the library, with a history of recent 
                            borrowers, the author, genre, and if is is currently returned 
                            or rented out. Finally, the "Stats by Account" page listed every 
                            library member alphabetically by last name, with a profile picture, 
                            general information about the member, as well as how many total 
                            books have been borrowed by the member.</p>
                            
                            <p>This project was designed to test my ability to 
                            create functions, higher order functions, various JS methods 
                            (such as find, filter, and map), and utilize string literals. 
                            I was to link the three databases (each styled as an object 
                            within a .js file) and output the results onto the web app. A 
                            total of 14 functions across 3 files were necessary to complete, 
                            with an additional helper function required to assist in at least 
                            one of the other functions.</p>

                            <p>DESCRIPTION: The project consists of three cipher, each unique to the other:</p>
                            <p>The Caesar Shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by 
                                Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies 
                                on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, 
                                based on the typical alphabetic order.</p>
                            <p>The Polybius Square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical 
                                alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. 
                                For example, in the above table, the letter "B" would be represented 
                                by the numerical pair "21".</p>
                            <p>The Substitution Cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution 
                                alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the 
                                standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the 
                                substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode 
                                the message.</p>

                            <p>DESCRIPTION: This project is designed to test my ability to build complex algorithms. 
                                It also focused on my ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai 
                                to test algorithms. For all three ciphers I had to ensure to ignore the 
                                letter casings and maintained spaces.</p>
                            <p>For the Caesar Shift, I had to ensure a false was returned had a shift 
                                of 0, 26 or greater, or a -26 or greater was submitted. I also had to 
                                wrap around the alphabet in the event a letter shifted past "z" or 
                                behind "a".</p>
                            <p>For the Polybius Square, I had to combine the values of "i" and "j" to 
                                maintain a perfect 5x5 square of alphabetical values. "thinkful" and 
                                "thjnkful" would return the same value.</p>
                            <p>For the Substitution cipher, I had to ensure a full 26 unique 
                                characters were input for the given alphabet.</p>

                        <p>I'm Andy Hotzler, a full-stack software engineer located in northern 
                            Minnesota with my domestic shorthair, Dahlia. I specialize in React and enjoy
                            studying UX/UI design. Two heads are always better than one,
                            and I enjoy reviewing code with colleagues to not only see how it can be improved,
                            but also how different approaches can reach a solution. Working alone has advantages,
                            but collaborating with a dedicated team cannot be matched.</p>
                        
                        <p>After graduating from Bemidji State University with three Bachelors 
                            and a minor, I began relearning web development and followed my interests 
                            into game and software development. After almost two years of Udemy courses 
                            and tutorial hell on YouTube and freecodecamp.org, I felt like I was only
                            placing pieces of a much larger puzzle together while being unable to see the larger 
                            picture. After researching bootcamps, curriculums, and job markets, I made the commitment 
                            enrolled in Thinkful's engineering immersion program.</p>
                        
                        <p>When I'm not coding or studying new languages/frameworks, I can be found 
                            butchering the German language, running it down Summoner's Rift in 
                            <em>League of Legends</em>, saving Tamriel in <em>Elder Scrolls 
                            Online</em>, or incorrectly sequencing my plays in <em>Magic: The 
                            Gathering</em>.</p>
