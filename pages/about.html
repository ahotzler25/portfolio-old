                    <p>I'm Andy Hotzler, a full-stack software engineer located in northern 
                        Minnesota with my domestic shorthair, Dahlia. I specialize in React and enjoy
                        studying UX/UI design. Two heads are always better than one,
                        and I enjoy reviewing code with colleagues to not only see how it can be improved,
                        but also how different approaches can reach a solution. Working alone has advantages,
                        but collaborating with a dedicated team cannot be matched.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p> Skills/Services: JavaScript, ECMAScript 6, HTML5, CSS3, UX/UI Design, React, PostgreSQL, Express.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Clients understand that a poorly designed, functional app--even if it's game-changing--will only be half 
                        as successful as it could be if it were well-designed. As a designer and a developer,
                        my job is to 1) help clients attain their wants/needs, and 2) make their project
                        look good. As a fullstack developer, I can bring your site to life by setting up a server
                        and design the frontend to your specifications. You'll be involved throughout the process
                        so that you can feel confident you're getting exactly what you want.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>After graduating from Bemidji State University with three Bachelors 
                        and a minor, I began relearning web development and followed my interests 
                        into game and software development. After almost two years of Udemy courses 
                        and tutorial hell on YouTube and freecodecamp.org, I felt like I was only
                        placing pieces of a much larger puzzle together while being unable to see the larger 
                        picture. After researching bootcamps, curriculums, and job markets in Minneapolis and 
                        Winnipeg, I made the commitment enrolled in Thinkful's engineering immersion program.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>When I'm not coding or studying new languages/frameworks, I can be found 
                        butchering the German language, running it down Summoner's Rift in 
                        <em>League of Legends</em>, saving Tamriel in <em>Elder Scrolls 
                        Online</em>, or incorrectly sequencing my plays in <em>Magic: The 
                        Gathering</em>.</p>
