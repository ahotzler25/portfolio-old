                                The HTML and CSS were provided by the course, requiring only

                                popular categories. The "Stats by Book" page provided a list

                                borrowers, the author, genre, and if is is currently returned 
                                or rented out. Finally, the "Stats by Account" page listed every 
                                library member alphabetically by last name, with a profile picture, 
                                general information about the member, as well as how many total

                            <p>This project was designed to test my ability to 
                                create functions, higher order functions, various methods 
                                (such as find, filter, and map), and utilize string literals, 
                                among other learning objectives. I was to link the three 
                                databases (each styled as an object within a .js file) and 
                                output the results onto the web app. A total of 14 functions 
                                across 3 files were necessary to complete, with an additional 
                                helper function required to assist in at least one of the other 
                                functions.</p>

                            <p><em>Description:</em></p>
                            <p>The project consists of three cipher, each unique to the other:</p>
                            <p>The Caesar Shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by 
                                Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies 
                                on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, 
                                based on the typical alphabetic order.</p>
                            <p>The Polybius Square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical 
                                alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. 
                                For example, in the above table, the letter "B" would be represented 
                                by the numerical pair "21".</p>
                            <p>The Substitution Cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution 
                                alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the 
                                standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the 
                                substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode 
                                the message.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p><em>Purpose:</em></p>
                            <p>This project is designed to test my ability to build complex algorithms. 
                                It also focused on my ability to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai 
                                to test algorithms. For all three ciphers I had to ensure to ignore the 
                                letter casings and maintained spaces.</p>
                            <p>For the Caesar Shift, I had to ensure a false was returned had a shift 
                                of 0, 26 or greater, or a -26 or greater was submitted. I also had to 
                                wrap around the alphabet in the event a letter shifted past "z" or 
                                behind "a".</p>
                            <p>For the Polybius Square, I had to combine the values of "i" and "j" to 
                                maintain a perfect 5x5 square of alphabetical values. "thinkful" and 
                                "thjnkful" would return the same value.</p>
                            <p>For the Substitution cipher, I had to ensure a full 26 unique 
                                characters were input for the given alphabet.</p>
